\scriptsize{Notes: $^{***}p<0.01$; $^{**}p<0.05$; $^{*}p<0.1$. The dependent variables are based on surveys, are all Likert scale variables based on the following statements: (i) 'Please tell me whether the following is true or not: My firm does not pay all the [Direct taxes] it is required to pay.', (ii) 'Please tell me whether you think that the following action is not wrong at all, wrong but understandable, or wrong and punishable: Firms not paying the taxes they owe to the government.', (iii) 'Please state your level of agreement with the following statements: If I was sure I would not get caught, I would not pay all the taxes that I owe.', (iv) 'Please state your level of agreement with the following statements: Firms should refuse to pay taxes until they get better services from the national government.' and (v) The mean of the aforementioned 4 variables. The independent variable is one for any respondent who were treated themselves in the first survey wave in December 2022, and 0 for everyone else. We cluster standard errors at the ward level.}
