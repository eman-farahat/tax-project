\scriptsize{Notes: $^{***}p<0.01$; $^{**}p<0.05$; $^{*}p<0.1$. The dependent variables are based on surveys, are all Likert scale variables based on the following statements: (i) 'In the last six months, how many times (if at all) did a tax inspector or tax agent from the TRA visit your business to ask you to pay taxes?', (ii) 'Was the interaction with the TRA friendly?', (iii) 'Which of the following best describes how you view these visits?', (v) 'C8. Was an informal gift or payment ever expected or requested during these visits?', (vi) 'TRA makes it easy for you to pay your taxes', and (vii) 'TRA treats all taxpayers fairly'. The independent variable is one for any respondent who were treated themselves in the first survey wave in December 2022, and 0 for everyone else. We cluster standard errors at the ward level.}
