\scriptsize{Notes: $^{***}p<0.01$; $^{**}p<0.05$; $^{*}p<0.1$. The dependent variables are based on actual or hypothetical scenarios and they are (i) a 3-scale variable based on the question 'Did you feel treated respectfully and fairly?' during the treatment (the presence of the TRA during the survey), (ii) a 5-scale variable based on the question 'How did you feel at the sights of the TRA vehicles moving around in your area' and (iii) a 4-scale variable based on the question 'Did you feel deceived?' with the presence of the TRA during the survey. The independent variable is one for any respondent who were treated themselves in the first survey wave in December 2022, and 0 for everyone else. We cluster standard errors at the ward level.}
