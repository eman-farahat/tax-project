\scriptsize{Notes: $^{***}p<0.01$; $^{**}p<0.05$; $^{*}p<0.1$. The dependent variables are based on surveys, are all Likert scale variables based on the following statements: (i) 'The risk of legal action for firms evading or underpaying taxes in Tanzania is high', (ii) 'The public services provided by the government justify the taxes imposed on firms', and (iii) 'Additional services benefiting firms would justify higher taxes'. The independent variable is one for any respondent who were treated themselves in the first survey wave in December 2022, and 0 for everyone else. We cluster standard errors at the ward level.}
